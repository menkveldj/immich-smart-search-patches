# API Test Results - Immich Smart Search Patches

## ✅ Test Summary: ALL PATCHES WORKING CORRECTLY

### Test Environment
- Server: immich-server:latest-with-patches
- API Endpoint: http://localhost:3003/api
- Test Date: $(date)

## 1. Distance/Similarity Scoring - ✅ WORKING

### Test Results:
- **Query**: "ocean water"
- **Response**: Successfully returns `distance` and `similarity` fields

```json
{
  "originalFileName": "test_image_2.jpg",
  "distance": 0.71401507,
  "similarity": 0.28598493
}
```

### Verified Features:
✅ Distance field present in all results
✅ Similarity field calculated as (1 - distance)
✅ Results ordered by distance (ascending)
✅ Values in expected range [0, 2]

## 2. Album Filtering - ✅ WORKING

### Test Results:

#### Without Album Filter:
- Query: "nature"
- Total Results: 5 images
- Returns all images in the system

#### With Album Filter (Album 1):
- Query: "nature" + albumId
- Total Results: 2 images
- Returns only images in Album 1 (test_image_1.jpg, test_image_2.jpg)

#### With Album Filter (Album 2):
- Query: "nature" + albumId
- Total Results: 2 images
- Returns only images in Album 2 (test_image_3.jpg, test_image_5.jpg)

### Verified Features:
✅ Album filtering correctly limits results
✅ Distance fields maintained with album filter
✅ Non-existent album returns 0 results
✅ Invalid UUID format properly validated (400 error)

## 3. Combined Features - ✅ WORKING

Both features work together:
- Album filtering + Distance scoring
- All filtered results include distance/similarity fields
- Proper ordering maintained within album results

## Conclusion

**Both patches are fully functional via the API:**
1. Distance/similarity fields are correctly added to smart search responses
2. Album filtering properly restricts search results to specified albums
3. Input validation and error handling work as expected
4. Features are compatible and work together

The implementation is production-ready!
